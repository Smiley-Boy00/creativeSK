## :fax: About
*Procedural Joint Builder and Rig Planning Tool for Autodesk Maya* </br>
Creative Skeletons is a Python driven joint chain builder designed to help plan, validate, and construct skeletons in a consistent and scalable way inside Maya.  
The tool focuses on rig integrity, automation, and repeatable workflows rather than manual joint placement.

### Design Philosophy

• Data driven over manual edits  
• Rebuildable systems over destructive workflows  
• Clear separation between planning and execution  
• Readable and maintainable code  

This project is part of an ongoing rigging and tooling portfolio focused on system driven rig development using Maya Python and the OpenMaya API.

## :bulb: Tool Source Code and Details
### Current Release: v0.1.1
### Skeleton Builder: v0.1.1
### Shape Library: v0.2.1

## Core Features

• Locator based joint planning system  
• Automated joint creation from validated locator data  
• Custom locator shapes for better viewport clarity  
• Clean hierarchy generation  
• Rebuild friendly workflow  
• Dynamic UI utilizing PySide6

## Workflow

1. Create planning locators for character or asset  
2. Adjust placement with visual feedback  
3. Validate structure and relationships  
4. Build joints automatically from the locator data  
5. Iterate safely without breaking the system  

## :bookmark_tabs: How to Install

> - Extract **creativeSK** and place the folder contents inside your Maya directory plug-ins folder, if no plug-ins folder exists create one:
**/maya/plug-ins** (this directory is usually found in the Documents folder).
> - Place **out_cLocator.png** icon inside **/maya/prefs/icons**, create onne if it doesn't exist.
> - Inside Maya, go to **Windows -> Settings/Preferences -> Plug-in Manager**.
> - In the **Plug-in Manager** enable the **MtoU.py** plugin, a tab named "Exporter Tools" should appear where you can start utilizing the MtoU exporter.
