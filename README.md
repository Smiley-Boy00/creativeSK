**Procedural Joint Builder and Rig Planning Tool for Autodesk Maya**

Creative Skeletons is a Python driven joint chain builder designed to help plan, validate, and construct skeletons in a consistent and scalable way inside Maya.  
The tool focuses on rig integrity, automation, and repeatable workflows rather than manual joint placement.

This project is part of an ongoing rigging and tooling portfolio focused on system driven rig development using Maya Python and the OpenMaya API.

## Core Features

• Locator based joint planning system  
• Automated joint creation from validated locator data  
• Custom locator shapes for better viewport clarity  
• Clean hierarchy generation  
• Rebuild friendly workflow  
• Dynamic UI utilizing PySide6

## Workflow

1. Create planning locators for character or asset  
2. Adjust placement with visual feedback  
3. Validate structure and relationships  
4. Build joints automatically from the locator data  
5. Iterate safely without breaking the system  

## Design Philosophy

• Data driven over manual edits  
• Rebuildable systems over destructive workflows  
• Clear separation between planning and execution  
• Readable and maintainable code  

This tool is intentionally kept modular so it can evolve into full rig builders in the future.

## Roadmap

• Validation and error reporting  
• Metadata driven joint rules  
• Integration with future rig modules  
• Expanded API level control  

---

## Project Status

Active development  
This project evolves as part of an ongoing rigging and technical art learning path.

Expect frequent refactors as systems improve.
